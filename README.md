### How to build

Clone this repository

``` 
git clone https://github.com/raulgrell/WebProject
cd WebProject
```

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

To use the development server, launch the dev:server and dev:app scripts in separate terminals.

The server will restart on any changes, and the client app will automatically reload modules when they are changed.

```
npm run dev:server
npm run dev:app
```

To run the production version, build the client and start the server.

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
